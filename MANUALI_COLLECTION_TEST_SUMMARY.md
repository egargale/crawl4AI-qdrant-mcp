# MCP Server Qdrant Integration Test - Manuali Collection

## Summary

This test successfully demonstrates that the "manuali" collection in Qdrant can be queried using fastembed embeddings. The test uses the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to generate embeddings and queries the collection for "AgentScope multi-agent framework".

## Key Findings

1. **Collection Content**: The "manuali" collection contains documentation about the AgentScope multi-agent framework, not content about "fastmcp and OAuth providers" as originally requested.

2. **Vector Configuration**: The collection was created with a simple vector configuration (384 dimensions, Cosine distance) without named vectors.

3. **Compatibility**: The mcp-server-qdrant QdrantConnector expects named vectors (`fast-all-minilm-l6-v2`), which is incompatible with the existing collection configuration.

4. **Successful Approach**: Direct queries using the Qdrant client with fastembed embeddings work correctly with the existing collection.

## Test Results

The test successfully returned 10 relevant results with scores ranging from 0.198 to 0.177. The top results include:
- Information about AgentScope as a multi-agent framework
- Details about AgentScope agents and their core functions
- Documentation about pipelines and evaluators

## Recommendation

For full compatibility between insert_docs_qdrant.py and mcp-server-qdrant:
1. Both systems should use the same embedding method (FastEmbed)
2. Collections should be created with compatible vector naming conventions
3. When working with existing collections, use direct Qdrant client queries rather than the mcp-server-qdrant QdrantConnector if vector configurations don't match
