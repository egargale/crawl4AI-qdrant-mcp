# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create integration tests to verify that documents inserted by `insert_docs_qdrant.py` can be correctly found by mcp-server-qdrant find functionality in a RAG system.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Qdrant as a vector database with Crawl4AI for web crawling
- Two embedding methods are supported: OpenAI API and FastEmbed
- mcp-server-qdrant uses FastEmbed with specific vector naming conventions (`fast-{model_name}`)
- For compatibility, both insertion and retrieval systems must use the same embedding method
- The system supports chunking documents by header hierarchy while preserving semantic structure
- Integration tests require proper environment variables (QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY, DASHSCOPE_API_KEY)

## Recent Actions
- Created three integration test files:
  1. `test_mcp_integration_simple.py` - Basic FastEmbed compatibility test
  2. `test_mcp_integration_comprehensive.py` - Multi-document semantic search test
  3. `test_e2e_integration.py` - End-to-end workflow verification
- Discovered and resolved vector naming mismatch issues between insert script and mcp-server-qdrant
- Verified that documents inserted using FastEmbed can be successfully retrieved by mcp-server-qdrant
- Created documentation in `INTEGRATION_TESTS_README.md` explaining test usage and compatibility requirements
- All integration tests are now passing, confirming the end-to-end workflow functions correctly

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Create simple integration test using FastEmbed for both insertion and retrieval
2. [DONE] Create comprehensive integration test with multiple documents and search queries
3. [DONE] Create end-to-end test demonstrating the full workflow between insert_docs_qdrant.py and mcp-server-qdrant
4. [DONE] Verify that documents inserted by insert_docs_qdrant.py can be found by mcp-server-qdrant find functionality
5. [DONE] Document integration test findings and compatibility requirements
