# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To integrate and test the compatibility between the `insert_docs_qdrant.py` script and the `mcp-server-qdrant` find functionality for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Qdrant vector database.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Python 3.13+ with Qdrant as the vector database
- Two embedding methods are supported: OpenAI API and FastEmbed
- The `insert_docs_qdrant.py` script can crawl web content, process it into semantic chunks, and store it in Qdrant
- The `mcp-server-qdrant` provides find functionality for semantic search using the same vector database
- For compatibility, both systems must use the same embedding method and vector naming conventions
- FastEmbed uses a specific naming convention for vector names: `fast-{model_name_part}`
- The "manuali" collection in Qdrant contains AgentScope documentation, not fastmcp/OAuth content

## Recent Actions
- Created integration tests to verify documents inserted by `insert_docs_qdrant.py` can be found by `mcp-server-qdrant`
- Discovered that the "manuali" collection was created with simple vector configuration (384 dimensions) incompatible with mcp-server-qdrant's named vector expectations
- Modified test approach to use direct Qdrant client queries instead of mcp-server-qdrant connector for compatibility
- Successfully demonstrated that the "manuali" collection can be queried for AgentScope-related content using fastembed embeddings
- Identified that `insert_docs_qdrant.py` deletes and recreates collections when embedding dimensions don't match, potentially erasing previous documents
- Modified `insert_docs_qdrant.py` to automatically detect correct FastEmbed model dimensions to prevent unnecessary collection recreation

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Create simple integration test using FastEmbed for both insertion and retrieval
2. [DONE] Create comprehensive integration test with multiple documents and search queries
3. [DONE] Create end-to-end test demonstrating the full workflow between insert_docs_qdrant.py and mcp-server-qdrant
4. [DONE] Verify that documents inserted by insert_docs_qdrant.py can be found by mcp-server-qdrant find functionality
5. [DONE] Analyze why "manuali" collection queries for "fastmcp and OAuth providers" didn't return expected results
6. [DONE] Identify and fix the collection recreation issue in insert_docs_qdrant.py when using FastEmbed
7. [TODO] Run additional tests to ensure the modified insert_docs_qdrant.py properly preserves existing documents when adding new ones to the same collection
8. [TODO] Create documentation for proper usage of insert_docs_qdrant.py with mcp-server-qdrant for optimal compatibility
