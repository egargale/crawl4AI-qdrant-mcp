# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Qdrant as the vector database and Crawl4AI for web crawling, with proper project setup using UV package manager.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.13+, Qdrant vector database, Crawl4AI web crawling library, DashScope API for embeddings and LLM
- **Project Structure**: Uses UV for package management with pyproject.toml and uv.lock files
- **Core Components**: 
  - `insert_docs_qdrant.py`: Crawl and insert documents into Qdrant
  - `retrieve_docs_qdrant.py`: Document retrieval with CLI interface
  - `rag_agent_qdrant.py`: RAG agent implementation using Pydantic AI
  - `test_retrieval.py`: Test script for retrieval functionality
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses .env file with QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY, and DASHSCOPE_API_KEY variables
- **Dependencies**: Managed through UV with comprehensive requirements imported from requirements.txt

## Recent Actions
- Created comprehensive QWEN.md documentation file explaining the project structure, setup, and usage
- Generated .gitignore file with appropriate Python and project-specific ignores
- Initialized project for UV package management and imported all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Resolved package conflicts (specifically with pyperclip) and created working pyproject.toml and uv.lock files
- Modified `test_retrieval.py` to accept command line arguments for search queries, collection names, and result counts
- Created `insert_test_docs.py` workaround script to manually insert test documents into Qdrant due to Windows encoding issues with Crawl4AI
- Successfully tested retrieval functionality with multiple queries showing proper semantic search results
- Created README.md with project overview and usage instructions

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Set up project with UV package manager
2. [DONE] Import dependencies from requirements.txt
3. [DONE] Create comprehensive project documentation
4. [DONE] Modify test_retrieval.py to accept command line arguments
5. [DONE] Create workaround for document insertion due to Crawl4AI Windows issues
6. [DONE] Test retrieval functionality with multiple queries
7. [TODO] Investigate and resolve Crawl4AI Windows encoding issues
8. [TODO] Add comprehensive tests for all components
9. [TODO] Implement CI/CD pipeline
10. [TODO] Add type hints and documentation strings to all functions
