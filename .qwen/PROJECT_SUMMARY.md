# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Qdrant as the vector database and Crawl4AI for web crawling that supports both OpenAI API and FastEmbed embedding methods for compatibility with MCP servers.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.7+, Qdrant vector database, Crawl4AI web crawling library, OpenAI/DashScope API, Pydantic AI
- **Core Components**: Web crawling, document processing, vector storage, retrieval system, RAG agent
- **Embedding Methods**: OpenAI API (default) and FastEmbed (for MCP server compatibility)
- **Key Fix**: Documents in Qdrant must include actual content in the "document" field for RAG agent to work properly
- **Agent Prompting**: Pydantic AI agent requires explicit system prompts to ensure tool usage
- **FastEmbed Integration**: Uses local embedding generation compatible with MCP servers, already available in requirements.txt as `qdrant-client[fastembed]`

## Recent Actions
- **Fixed RAG Agent Issues**: Resolved problems with document retrieval by ensuring documents include content in "document" field and improving agent system prompt
- **Implemented FastEmbed Support**: Added command-line options (`--embedding-method`, `--fastembed-model`) to insert_docs_qdrant.py script
- **Enhanced Document Processing**: Modified script to support .md files and handle both OpenAI and FastEmbed embedding methods
- **Verified Compatibility**: Tested FastEmbed with Qdrant to ensure compatibility with MCP servers
- **Code Improvements**: Added proper error handling, type hints, and conditional imports for FastEmbed

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Research fastembed library integration with Qdrant
2. [DONE] Add command-line option for embedding method selection (OpenAI API vs fastembed)
3. [DONE] Implement fastembed embedding generation function
4. [DONE] Modify insert_documents_to_qdrant function to support both embedding methods
5. [DONE] Update get_embedding_client function to handle fastembed initialization
6. [DONE] Add fastembed dependencies to requirements.txt
7. [DONE] Test with MCP server compatibility
8. [TODO] Document the new FastEmbed functionality for users
9. [TODO] Consider adding more FastEmbed model options
10. [TODO] Add validation for FastEmbed model compatibility with Qdrant dimensions
